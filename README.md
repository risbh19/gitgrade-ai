# GitGrade – AI GitHub Repository Evaluator

GitGrade is an AI-powered system that analyzes a public GitHub repository and evaluates it the way a **recruiter or senior mentor** would. It generates a **score**, a **professional summary**, and a **personalized improvement roadmap** based entirely on repository data.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Students often maintain GitHub repositories without knowing how their projects appear to recruiters or mentors. There is a gap between *having code* and *understanding its real quality*.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

GitGrade acts as a **Repository Mirror**:
- Accepts a public GitHub repository URL
- Fetches real repository data using GitHub API
- Applies **rule-based, explainable evaluation**
- Generates:
  - 📊 A quality score (0–100)
  - 🧠 A concise professional summary
  - 🛠️ A personalized, actionable improvement roadmap

The goal is **honest feedback + clear guidance**, not just a number.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a public GitHub repository URL  
2. The system fetches repository signals:
   - File count & structure  
   - README presence  
   - Test indicators  
   - Commit history  
   - Primary language  
3. A rule-based scoring engine evaluates repository quality  
4. AI-assisted feedback converts results into:
   - Human-readable summary  
   - Mentor-style improvement roadmap
