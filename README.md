# GitGrade – AI GitHub Repository Evaluator

GitGrade is an AI-powered system that analyzes a public GitHub repository and evaluates it the way a **recruiter or senior mentor** would. It generates a **score**, a **professional summary**, and a **personalized improvement roadmap** based entirely on repository data.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Students often maintain GitHub repositories without knowing how their projects appear to recruiters or mentors. There is a gap between *having code* and *understanding its real quality*.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

GitGrade acts as a **Repository Mirror**:
- Accepts a public GitHub repository URL
- Fetches real repository data using GitHub API
- Applies **rule-based, explainable evaluation**
- Generates:
  - 📊 A quality score (0–100)
  - 🧠 A concise professional summary
  - 🛠️ A personalized, actionable improvement roadmap

The goal is **honest feedback + clear guidance**, not just a number.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters a public GitHub repository URL  
2. The system fetches repository signals:
   - File count & structure  
   - README presence  
   - Test indicators  
   - Commit history  
   - Primary language  
3. A rule-based scoring engine evaluates repository quality  
4. AI-assisted feedback converts results into:
   - Human-readable summary  
   - Mentor-style improvement roadmap

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The GitGrade project is organized with a clear and modular structure to ensure readability and maintainability. The main Streamlit application is implemented in app.py, which serves as the entry point and orchestrates the complete analysis workflow. Core logic is separated into a utils module that handles distinct responsibilities: github_fetcher.py is responsible for collecting repository data using the GitHub API, scoring.py applies rule-based evaluation to compute an explainable quality score, and ai_feedback.py generates the professional summary and personalized improvement roadmap. Visual assets used for demonstration purposes are stored in the assets directory, which includes screenshots of the application interface and analysis output. Dependency management is handled through requirements.txt, ignored files and local environments are managed via .gitignore, and the overall project documentation and usage instructions are provided in README.md.
